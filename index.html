              It can be overwhelming trying to find reliable information on the internet, or even from word of mouth these days, so I have linked some of the best companies I have had personal experience with, down below! Just click on an image and you will be directed to their website.

                <h3>Choosing the right lender</h3>
                <p>
                  Finding a lender can be daunting. You don't know if you'll be approved and you don't know if the people you are working with are really looking out for you.
                </p>

                <h3>Managing Time</h3>
                <p>
                  Managing your time spent from start to finish. Your time is important to me. I don't want to waste it by sending you to homes that I don't believe are the right fit or suit your needs. I don't want you to work with companies that don't treat you like family, or the very least with respect. We won't be driving all over town just to be disappointed.

                <h3>Feeding your mind in the process</h3>
                <p>
                  A lot of times, buyers and sellers are put in tough positions and are asked to make decisions on things they really know nothing about like, offer contracts. They can be long or short, but are filled with real estate jargone that most people just take the agents word for it. I promise to educate you on every detail during the buying or selling process.

                <h3>Finally making the sale</h3>
                <p>
                  Once we have finally narrowed down the right home, know that it's not the final stage of our time together but the start, especially if you are a new buyer or seller. I won't let go of your hand just because the sale closes.

              <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
              <p>
                I have always had a strong interest in Entrepreneurship, Sustainability, and Renewable energy. Most of my education was obtained at the Santa Fe Community College. Before becoming a Real Estate Broker I worked many years in customer service and the hospitality industry. As New Mexicos Green Collar Broker it is my goal to push for more green residential communities. I hope to one day see more residential communities that promote solar power and geothermal energy. My motive is to help working families save money while leaving the world better then I found it. I work systematically and with a sense of urgency and together we can achieve your real estate goals!
              </p> </br>
              <h3><strong>Collaborate</strong></h3>
              <p>
                One of the many things I have learned about real estate is that there are many moving parts to a Real Estate transaction and I have a true understanding of what it takes to collaborate with others. I have personally built relationships with Mortgage Lenders, Escrow officers, insurance agencies, and a security company to help in every phase of real estate. Learn more here about collaborations.

            <h3><strong>Associate Broker at Roc Real Estate</strong></h3>
            <p>
              I consider myself a native to New Mexico. I know Santa Fe, quite intimately and since moving to the Albuquerque/Rio Rancho area, I have made sure to get to know my new city just the same. I joined the admin team at ROC Real Estate Partners as the Listing Coordinator through a referral. As the listing coordinator, it allowed me to learn the mechanics of listing a property. With the motivation and support of my team, I confidently transitioned to a full-time broker. Click to learn more about ROC Real Estate Partners

              It can be overwhelming trying to find reliable information on the internet, or even from word of mouth these days, so I have linked some of the best companies I have had personal experience with, down below! Just click on an image and you will be directed to their website.

            <h3>Choosing the right lender</h3>
            <p>
              Finding a lender can be daunting. I'll make the best recommendations.

            <h3>Managing Time</h3>
            <p>
              Managing your time spent from start to finish. Your time is important to me. I don't want to waste it by sending you to homes that I don't believe are the right fit or suit your needs. We won't be driving all over town just to be disappointed.

            <h3>Feeding your mind in the process</h3>
            <p>
              I promise to educate you on every detail during the buying or selling process. Whether it be going through contracts line by line or clarifying some real estate jargon.

            <h3>Finally making the sale</h3>
            <p>
              Once we have finally narrowed down the right home, know that it's not the final stage of our time together but the start. I won't let go of your hand just because the sale closes.
